          <p> In the digital world, DeFi and GameFi seems to grow seperately apart for long. Though these 2 genres both
            link to Finance, the connection between them fade away gradually.</p>
          <p> We are NFT Fanatic and dig in exploring fantastic art work in digital world. NFT contains more over the
            original art, further in owning that moment of flowing time when the artist created it. It’s an unique digital
            way to mark time. While in the same time, we are the early miners and dive in DeFi mining world since 2019.
            Such, we are wondering that whether we could find an approach to spread the tentacle of NFT, building a bridge
            between GameFi and DeFi as well as digital identity confirmation.</p>
          <p>We figuer that, partnering with DeFi protocols could be a start to find another way of gathering DeFi and art
            world. Such as he Bored Ape, building the consensus on-chain and even more, solid digital community borned
            based on the magic NFTs. Plus Axie pets, these cuties in digital battle could bring in considerable income
            daily for the players. Literally, digital art could take more than what the original art meaning. This would
            be one of the core things in web3.0.</p>
          <p>We do not want to perform merely as the designers or publisher, additionally, we work for making a neo Dapp
            where NFTs there are endowdd with new functions more than trading or mining. The NFT there could be the
            identity of your digital pass, or even the collateral in your assets managing. Or, this would be a gate of the
            Metaverse.</p>
          <p>When we embark on the magic journey, you could imagine that your NFT profile pic would be your ID when you
            walk through the digital world, the same time, several streams of rewards and social functions would come
            along. I believe, this is exact the Meterverse that we are fighting for.</p>
          <p>We are experimenting and let’s start with the Dusk.</p>
